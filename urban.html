        <p class="features-para">Our Urban Solution is an agile, software-based approach to RAN infrastructure, which is designed to allow MNOs to quickly deploy network upgrades at a lower TCO. The following describes the features and benefits of our state-of-the-art Urban Solution:</p>
    
    <ul class="list-items mt-3">
        <li class="features-list"><span class="lists">Innovate-</span>Proprietary interfaces and limited flexibility with legacy suppliers make it challenging for MNOs to maintain, expand, and upgrade their networks to meet future demands. With our Parallel Wireless Urban solution, MNOs can avoid vendor lock-in, scale and enable new innovative services seamlessly with cloud-native centralized tools such as Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD), DevOps, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).</p>
        </li>
        <li class="features-list"><span class="lists">Futureproof for 5G-</span>MNOs need to upgrade their networks to prepare for the explosive data demands such as Internet of Things (IoT), Industry 4.0, autonomous driving, and digital health. With our Urban solution MNOs can upgrade their networks to any G with a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) vBBU which is easy to install, has open interfaces and supports a broad ecosystem of vendors across 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G, preparing networks for the future.<br/>
            Easy to install, modernize and expand networks – The costs to deploy and maintain networks and the lack of interoperability can be daunting as many operators are supporting 2G voice while migrating to 4G data and preparing for the greater bandwidth possibilities of 5G. Easily change and upgrade technologies to support emerging needs with our cloud-native software-based solution.

        <li class="features-list"><span class="lists">Reduce Total Cost of Ownership(TCO)-</span>Network Operations Center (NOC), zoning and permits, management services, power and backhaul, are a few of the many expenses required to maintain and upgrade networks. A cloud-native, software-defined architecture with state-of-the art features such as RAN automation, self-configuration, hands free software testing, integration and delivery drives down costs and improves interoperability. A container based DU/CU implementation across ALL Gs, enables faster time-to-market for new services and features enabling OPEX and CAPEX savings.
